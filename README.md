Predicting outcome of the football match in English Premier League (EPL) using machine learning algorithms (Sports Analytics/ Betting)

Background: Data analytics is booming all around the world and has been extensively used
in the field of sports specifically in football for decision making, while also aiding to establish
positive economic value. The use of machine learning algorithms in predicting the outcome
of the football matches is becoming popular which can be used to compete with the
bookmakers, can also be used to provide an unique value to the team and much academic
research has been done on this subject area.

Aim: The research aim of this project is to develop a generalised model using machine
learning techniques to predict the outcome of the EPL matches, which is the target variable
of this study, called as ‘Full Time Result’ (FTR). The model could not only be used for betting
purposes to make profits but could also be used for fantasy sports and add an unique value
to the team.

Methods: A deductive research approach is adapted to the study's goal of using historical
data to predict the results of EPL football games. a quantitative methodology is followed to
accomplish the study's objectives. And the data mining steps were employed for the
prediction problem in this study such as Data Collection, Data preprocessing, Exploratory
Data Analysis, Feature Selection, Feature Engineering, Machine Learning Algorithms,
Evaluation, Validation and Hyper-parameter Optimization.

Results: The models were trained using the three algorithms that are Support Vector
Machine, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting. The results were examined as
per the case studies based on the different feature sets in each case study. The results
found that the SVM model built using all the extracted features including match statistics,
bookie prediction feature and weather features produced the highest accuracy of 71.57%
and proved to be the best performing model in this study among all three models.

Conclusions: The field of sports analytics is becoming more advanced and is useful in
making strategic decisions in favour of a sports team. This research has shown that using
machine learning techniques and including the weather features and information contained
in the betting odds from the bookmakers along with the match statistics can help in building
significantly accurate prediction models for match outcomes.
